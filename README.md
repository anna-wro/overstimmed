# 🌀 Overstimmed

**Because some days are just a lot.**

Track your overstimulation, energy, and emotional patterns - and finally understand what's really draining or recharging you.

## 💬 Your Experience Is Valid

You're not lazy. You're not broken.  
You're just **overstimmed**.

Whether you're autistic, ADHD, highly sensitive - or just burnt out by life - your energy isn't random. It's shaped by triggers, tasks, and sensory input you might not even notice until it's too late.

Overstimmed helps you notice — gently.

## 🧰 What Overstimmed Helps You Do

- Track your **energy** and **overstimulation** (1–10 scale)  
- Note if stimulation felt **positive**, **neutral**, or **overwhelming**  
- Spot **patterns**: what drains you, what helps

## 🌱 Why It Matters

When you can name what drains you, you can plan better days.  
When you notice what soothes you, you can make space for it.  
When you trust your own brain, everything changes.

> You don't need to push through.  
> You need tools that see you.

## 🫂 No Fixing. No Judging.

Overstimmed isn't here to make you more "normal."  
It's here to help you **know yourself** - as you are.

We're not here to measure how much you get done.  
We're here to help you notice how you feel.  
No streaks. No scores. Just gentle awareness, one moment at a time.

Whether you had a meltdown, masked too hard, or just feel "off" - this is a place to log it without fear.

> You don't need to justify your needs.  
> You just need a space to listen to them.
